The dataset I used contains 7023 human brain MRI images, which I sorted into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor.
I sourced the images from the following datasets:

1. figshare dataset (Used for glioma class)
This dataset, provided by Jun Cheng, is one of the most widely cited for this task.
It contains T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images for three tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary.

2. SARTAJ Dataset (Used for meningioma and pituitary classes)
This dataset, available on Kaggle, contains images for four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor.

3. Br35H Dataset (Used for no tumor class)
This dataset is also available on Kaggle and is often used for binary classification (tumor vs. no tumor).
